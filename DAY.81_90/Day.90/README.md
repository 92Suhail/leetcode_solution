Question: Path Sum<br/>
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.<br/>


Example 1:<br/>
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22<br/>
Output: true<br/>
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.<br/>

Example 2:<br/>
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5<br/>
Output: false<br/>
Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:<br/>
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.<br/>
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.<br/>
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.<br/>

Example 3:<br/>
Input: root = [], targetSum = 0<br/>
Output: false<br/>
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.<br/>


Answer Approach:<br/>
For solving this question,<br/>
Firstly we at each node, if it is a leaf (both children are null), check if its value matches the remaining targetSum. For non-leaf nodes, subtract the nodeâ€™s value from targetSum and recursively check both left and right subtrees with the updated targetSum. Return true if any path meets the condition, otherwise return false.
