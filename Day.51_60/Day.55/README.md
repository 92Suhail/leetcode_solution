# Day 55:
Question: Find the Difference<br/>
You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.<br/>

 

Example 1:<br/>
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"<br/>
Output: "e"<br/>
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.<br/>

Example 2:<br/>
Input: s = "", t = "y"<br/>
Output: "y"<br/>
 


Answer Approach:<br/>
For solving this question,<br/>
Firstly initialize an array count to store the count of characters. Iterate through string s and increment the count for each character encountered. Then again iterate through string t and decrement the count for each character encountered. Look for the character with a non-zero count in the count array. This character is the one added to t.<br/>
Return the added character as the output.
